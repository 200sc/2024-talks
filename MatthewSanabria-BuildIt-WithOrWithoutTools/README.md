# Build It! With or Without Tools

This talk describes the parallels between building software and renovating a
house, focusing on how tools can simultaneously enable and hinder productivity,
creativity, and learning. Attendees will learn when to rely on their tools,
when to abandon their tools, and what tools Go provides to assist with building
software. Don't worry, a screwdriver isn't needed for this talk!
