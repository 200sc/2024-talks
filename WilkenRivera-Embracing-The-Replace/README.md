# Embracing the Replace

Learn how we used Go's replace directive to fix a critical issue in a core
library for HashiCorp Packer without affecting hundreds of users. I will
explain how we rolled out the patch to open-source plugins supporting major
cloud providers and added guard rails to prevent breaking changes while
ensuring a smooth transition to not disrupt plugin development over the
course of 8 weeks.
