# Who Tests the Tests?

A gentle introduction to mutation testing in Go.

## Talk Description

Testing is a cornerstone of modern software engineering: whether you adopt full-fledged Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices or write tests after you have finished your implementation, no serious workplace should tolerate code without tests. But how can we ensure that we are writing good tests? Are we really testing the code or just producing fake test coverage? To answer this question, we are going to explore the concept of mutation tests and how they can be used to validate the tests that we write. In this talk you will learn what a mutation test is and one possible implementation in Go with the help of the AST package and a bit of compiler magic.
