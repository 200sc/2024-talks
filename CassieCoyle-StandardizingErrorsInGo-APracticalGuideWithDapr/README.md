# Standardizing Errors in Go: A Practice Guide With Dapr

Let's explore the comprehensive error standardization package developed in Go,
focusing on practical implementations using the gRPC Richer Error Model and
Google API Errors Model within Dapr, the 10th largest CNCF project. You will
gain invaluable insights into standardizing errors in your Go programs by
delving into a dedicated open-source errors standardization package. Utilizing
the builder pattern, you will learn to craft standardized and enriched errors
effectively. Additionally, we'll delve into the current state of error
standardization efforts in Dapr, while offering actionable insights on seamlessly
integrating this standardized approach into your own codebases. Errors
